<p>Flexion Mini Quiz</p>
<p>This is a mini project I have completed for Flexion. In creating this small true or false quiz I have utilized the following languages 
and/or technologies.</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Stylus (css)</li>
<li>Prepros (to compile my Stylus to CSS)</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>GitHub (Version Control)</li>
</ol>
<p>As a front-end developer, that is a bit more on the design end of things, this was a great learning project for me and I look forward to
continuing my JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks learning in the future.</p>
<p>I was not able to incorporate CoffeeScript into this project, however, did take a look at it. I am going to be adding CoffeeScript to the 
ever growning list of languages/frameworks to learn!</p>
<p>Also, I have used NodeJS and Grunt to compile Less to CSS in the past, however, I did not use it on this project. My next goal would be to
get a NodeJS enviornment setup on my computer that would allow my to compile Stylus, Less, CoffeeScript..and the likes.</p>
