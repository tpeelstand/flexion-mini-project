Flexion Mini Quiz

This is a mini project I have completed for Flexion. In creating this small true or false quiz I have utilized the following languages 
and/or technologies.

1. HTML
2. Stylus (css)
3. Prepros (to compile my Stylus to CSS)
4. AngularJS
5. JSON
6. GitHub (Version Control)

EDIT: (2/10/2016) - I didn't use a Grunt build to do this project, however, I have now added one to this file. The Grunt build works to compile Stylus and Less at this point. Still working on getting it to compile Scss and Coffeescript.


To take the quiz goto: http://creative-cow-design.com/flexion/

As a front-end developer, that is a bit more on the design end of things, this was a great learning project for me and I look forward to
continuing my JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks learning in the future.

I was not able to incorporate CoffeeScript into this project, however, did take a look at it. I am going to be adding CoffeeScript to the ever growning list of languages/frameworks to learn!

Also, I have used NodeJS and Grunt to compile Less to CSS in the past, however, I did not use it on this project. My next goal would be to get a NodeJS enviornment setup on my computer that would allow my to compile Stylus, Less, CoffeeScript..and the likes.
